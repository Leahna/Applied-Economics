### Profile
I am a social person, eager to learn and open up to new things. I have a wide spread interest in different subjects, this can be seen in my diverse work experience. When I start something, I want to do this as good as possible. That is why I worked hard to graduate cum laude. Besides this I consider myself spontaneous and I love to work with other people. I can stand up for myself and my beliefs without being disrespectful. This is a valuable asset in my work as sales employee, and before also as a pollster.
